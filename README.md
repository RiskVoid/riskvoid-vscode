**Real-time security analysis for AI-generated code. Catch vulnerabilities before they reach production.**

RiskVoid detects security vulnerabilities commonly found in code generated by AI assistants like GitHub Copilot, Cursor, ChatGPT, and Claude.

---

## Why RiskVoid?

AI coding assistants are powerful productivity tools, but they can introduce security vulnerabilities:

- **SQL Injection** - Unsanitized database queries
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** - Unescaped user input in HTML
- **Command Injection** - Shell commands with user data
- **Hardcoded Secrets** - API keys, passwords, tokens in code
- **Weak Cryptography** - MD5/SHA1 for passwords, weak random
- **Path Traversal** - File access without validation

**RiskVoid transforms "500 vulnerabilities found" into "5 critical issues requiring immediate attention"** through intelligent prioritization based on business context.

## Features

### Real-Time Security Analysis

Get instant feedback as you write code. No need to run separate scans - security issues are highlighted the moment they're introduced.

- OWASP Top 10 vulnerability coverage
- Works with JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, and Java
- No configuration required - works out of the box

### Smart Prioritization

Not all vulnerabilities are equal. RiskVoid understands your code's context:

- Automatically identifies critical code paths (authentication, payments, data handling)
- Calculates risk scores based on business impact
- Filters noise so you focus on what matters

### Supply Chain Security

Monitor your dependencies for known vulnerabilities:

- Real-time CVE detection via OSV database
- Severity scores and fix recommendations
- Support for npm and pip packages

### Interactive Dashboard

Access your security posture at a glance:

- Real-time security score (0-100) in the status bar
- Comprehensive side panel with issue breakdown
- One-click navigation to vulnerable code
- Detailed explanations with remediation guidance
